I have been learning Java for a while. 
And I want to write some code to make projects. These sometimes from internet sometimes from My mind.Also sometimes from both of them.
I am a newbie. Therefore they may basic codes and basic projects.
I want to improve my self in java.

It is project called Hangman. There are not anybody don't know hangman. The Hangman is a game for kids and adults. It is basic but also fun.

There are three version files in this package. 

First is named HangMan_Array. Second is named HangMan_File and last one is named HangMan_Input.

How to run?

First: Code has a Array and you can write anything in the Array what you want to all things.

Second: There is a file named Names.txt. And you can write in the text file what you want to all things. In this way you can add any things from out.

Third: There is a Array but it is empty Array. And After to run code, you choose words count and you can enter words for asking.

Have fun...
